//! Higher order structures for functions (including data).
//!
//! ### Design
//!
//! `Data` variants stores the actual data.
//!
//! `Time` variants evaluates a higher homotopy function.
//! For example, a line in 3D has homotopy type `t -> point3`.
//! This is a function that can be evaluated using a scalar.
//! Since the function returns a 3D point, this particular `Time` variant
//! needs to be stored in the enum for `Point3`.
