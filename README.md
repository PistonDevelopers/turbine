A 3D game engine with built-in editor

*Notice! This project is in early phase. Expect bugs and missing features.*

This is a project to put together

### Development

Some parts of the engine will first be tested and developed as part of other projects.
For example, since Gfx is currently under heavy development,
some VR features will be developed using OpenGL and later ported to Gfx.

### Plans

- UI: [Conrod](https://github.com/pistondevelopers/conrod)
- Graphics: [Gfx](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx)
- Scripting: [Dyon](https://github.com/pistondevelopers/dyon)
- Reactive Design: [Turbine-Reactive](./reactive)
- Scene Rendering: [Turbine-Scene3D](./scene3d)
- VR support: [Rust-OpenVR](https://github.com/rust-openvr/rust-openvr)
